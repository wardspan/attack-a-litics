    title: "Differential Equations in Cyber Conflict",
    content: `
      Our model uses a system of differential equations to describe how cyber capabilities evolve over time.
      Think of it like predicting the weather - we use mathematical relationships to forecast future states.
      
      Each equation shows how one variable (like Defender Capability) changes based on:
      ‚Ä¢ Its current value
      ‚Ä¢ Interactions with other variables
      ‚Ä¢ External influences (parameters)
      
      The beauty of this approach is that it captures the dynamic, interconnected nature of cyber warfare.

  phaseSpace: {
    title: "Phase Space Analysis",
    content: `
      Phase space is a mathematical concept that helps us visualize how systems evolve over time.
      Instead of plotting variables against time, we plot them against each other.
      
      In our 3D phase plot:
      ‚Ä¢ Each point represents the system state at one moment
      ‚Ä¢ The trajectory shows how the system evolves
      ‚Ä¢ Colors indicate progression through time (blue ‚Üí red)
      ‚Ä¢ The shape tells us about system behavior
      
      Patterns you might see:
      ‚Ä¢ Spiral trajectories: Oscillating behavior
      ‚Ä¢ Straight lines: Monotonic changes
      ‚Ä¢ Closed loops: Periodic behavior
      ‚Ä¢ Converging paths: Stable outcomes
    `,
    interpretations: {
      convergent: "System reaches a stable equilibrium",
      divergent: "System becomes increasingly unstable",
      oscillatory: "System alternates between states",
      chaotic: "System exhibits unpredictable behavior"
    }
  },
  
  stability: {
    title: "Stability Analysis",
    content: `
      Stability analysis tells us about the long-term behavior of our cyber conflict system.
      We analyze the system's behavior near equilibrium points to predict outcomes.
      
      Key concepts:
      ‚Ä¢ Equilibrium: Where all variables stop changing
      ‚Ä¢ Stability: Whether small perturbations grow or shrink
      ‚Ä¢ Eigenvalues: Mathematical indicators of stability
      
      This analysis helps answer: "If we make small changes to our defenses, 
      will the system remain stable or become chaotic?"

  eigenvalues: {
    title: "Eigenvalues and System Behavior",
    content: `
      Eigenvalues are special numbers that tell us how a system behaves near equilibrium.
      Think of them as "growth rates" for different directions in phase space.
      
      What they tell us:
      ‚Ä¢ Positive eigenvalues: Growth/instability in that direction
      ‚Ä¢ Negative eigenvalues: Decay/stability in that direction
      ‚Ä¢ Complex eigenvalues: Oscillatory behavior
      ‚Ä¢ Zero eigenvalues: Neutral stability
      
      In cyber conflict:
      ‚Ä¢ All negative: Conflicts naturally resolve
      ‚Ä¢ Mixed signs: Sensitive to initial conditions
      ‚Ä¢ Complex values: Periodic cyber conflict cycles
    `,
    interpretation: {
      allNegative: "Stable system - conflicts resolve naturally",
      allPositive: "Unstable system - conflicts escalate",
      mixed: "Saddle point - outcome depends on starting conditions",
      complex: "Oscillatory behavior - cyclic conflicts"
    }
  },
  
  jacobian: {
    title: "Jacobian Matrix",
    content: `
      The Jacobian matrix shows how each variable influences every other variable's rate of change.
      It's like a "sensitivity analysis" - how does a small change in one variable affect others?
      
      Reading the matrix:
      ‚Ä¢ Rows represent variables (D, A, V, T)
      ‚Ä¢ Columns represent influences
      ‚Ä¢ Positive values: Reinforcing effect
      ‚Ä¢ Negative values: Opposing effect
      ‚Ä¢ Larger magnitude: Stronger influence
      
      This helps us understand:
      ‚Ä¢ Which variables are most influential
      ‚Ä¢ How changes propagate through the system
      ‚Ä¢ Why certain behaviors emerge
